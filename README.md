[View webpage in Github Pages]

This site is a work in progress and will be updated with new content.
In the future, I want to connect both my projects, MS1 and MS2, into one.

# Introduction

This is my second Mile Stone Project for Code Institute. 
 
For now, I decided to create this webpage for my family and friends in Poland. This is an online travel journal from trips around Ireland.  
For the purpose of this course, I will limit the website to only a few places in Ireland. 

Before I started creating this project, I thought about the aims and goals I want to achieve with this. Below, I list some of those answers: 

**My main goals:**

1.	I need some place, where I can improve my writing skills (writing posts
    only on Facebook/Instagram doesn’t give me full satisfaction).
2.	I want to showcase my husband’s photos and/or films from the trips on this
    website.
3.	I would like to build a community of people with similar interests to me in
    one place. 
4.	In the future, I would like to offer the website’s visitors my own services
    such as short-term flat rentals etc. 
5.	My personal goal is also to show my web developer skills.

# User Experience


## First time Visitor’s needs:

1.	They could look for nice places to visit on their trip to Ireland.
2.	They could look for maps, instructions or tips on how to travel around.
3.	They would want to easily navigate throughout the website.
4.	They could want to find social media links and/or a way to contact me.
5.	They could want to look at some pictures and/or films, and read a little
    more about recommended places.

`
## Returning visitors are very often interested in:

1.	Up to date information about travel.
2.	New articles on the website.
3.	Answers to their own questions, which can be available in FAQ (in future).
5.	Collaborating with me.
6.	Planning their own trips with me (available in the future).

## Features

### Global

This website will be very simple and intuitive, to give my audience a great user experience. 

That can be achieved by:
* Home button (logo placed on the top left corner).
* Responsive menu on the left side below logo,
* On the top right side, will insert the social icons to follow us on the 
  Instagram, Facebook and You Toube . Those links will be open in separate pages. 
* And footer stuck at the bottom of each page with copyright information. 


Because currently most people are watch the websites on smartphones, then this websate is create with the mobile first design.

Those features will be the same for all of my pages in website.
